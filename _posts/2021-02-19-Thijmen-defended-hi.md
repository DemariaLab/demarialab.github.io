Last Wednesday, 16 February, Thijmen, the first student of the Demaria lab,
successfully defended his thesis entitled: "The consequences of environmental
conditions for antagonistic pleiotropic effects of cellular senescence". We
wish him all the best in his future career!

Congratulations Thijmen!
