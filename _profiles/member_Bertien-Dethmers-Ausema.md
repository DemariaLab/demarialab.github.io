biography: "I am a real local. I grew up and have lived almost all my live within 15km of Groningen. I live with my husband in Eelde, my two children already have left the nest. In my free time I like to go dancing or go for a walk in the beautiful surroundings. I come to work by bike, get some fresh air and see a horizon before and after work! I have worked as a technician in ERIBA in the field of hematopoiesis and aging for a very long time. This was in the Stem Cell Biology lab of Gerald de Haan. Gerald left ERIBA in 2021, but I continued supporting the PhD students that we still had at the time until the last one finished in 2024. My field of expertise has been working with mice and doing FACS sorting and analysis of blood and bone marrow in the context of bone marrow transplantations. I have just joined Marco’s group and I am excited to see what this change of group will bring for me."
