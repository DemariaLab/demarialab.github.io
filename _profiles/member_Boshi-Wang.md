biography: "I come from China and I did my BSc at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and my MPhil at The University of Hong Kong. In September 2020, I received my PhD from the University of Groningen under the supervision of Prof. Marco Demaria. My PhD was mainly focused on three projects: 1) Exploring the roles of CDK4/6 inhibitors in senescence induction and cancer therapy; 2) Identifying the contribution of senescent cells to natural ageing; 3) Investigating the differential features of senescent cells from different sex origin. In my projects, transgenic/xenograft mouse models, mammalian cell models, RNA-sequencing and a series of biochemical methods were used. Now, I will continue in Marco Demariaâ€™s lab as a Postdoc to finish my PhD projects."
