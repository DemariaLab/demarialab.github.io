biography: "I come from China and I did my BSc study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and my MPhil study at The University of Hong Kong.

My research is mainly focused on three projects: 1) Exploring the roles of CDK4/6 inhibitors in senescence/SASP and cancer therapy; 2) Investigating the differential features of senescent cells from different sex origin; 3) Identifying the contribution of senescent cells to natural ageing; In my projects, patient biopsies, transgenic/xenograft mouse models, mammalian cell models, RNA-sequencing, proteomics, lipidomics and a series of biochemical methods are used."
