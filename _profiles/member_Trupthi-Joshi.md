biography: "I am from Bangalore, India, where I completed by Bachelor's in Biotechnology Engineering. After my bachelor’s, I worked as a research intern at the Center for Cellular and Molecular Platforms in Bangalore, where I worked on the pre-clinical trials for a diagnostic machine. I then proceeded on my Master’s journey and was accepted into the Erasmus Mundus program, International Master in Innovative Medicine. I completed my first year at Uppsala University, and then moved to Groningen for my second year at RuG. I performed my master's thesis at Dr. Demaria's lab under the supervision of Dr. Boshi Wang, where we investigated the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition on senescent cells and the subsequent effect on NK cell killing activity. Recently, I was awarded the GSMS fellowship to perform my PhD in the Demaria lab. My PhD project is on exploring the effects of senescence in the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment and how to design better therapeutic strategies. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, reading, watching (and rewatching) TV series and movies, and spending time with my friends and family."
