biography: "Originally from Berlin in Germany, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences at the Universität Potsdam, followed by a Master's degree in Biology at the Freie Universität in Berlin. During my master’s studies, I contributed to a variety of projects, which ranged from studying the innate immune system in mice to enhancing DNA transposon activity in human cells. My thesis explored the dynamics of the enigmatic Helraiser transposon and its host interactions. Driven by a profound interest in aging research, I am thrilled to have been offered a PhD position under the guidance of Marco Demaria at ERIBA. My upcoming research will focus on the role of cellular senescence in lung diseases."
