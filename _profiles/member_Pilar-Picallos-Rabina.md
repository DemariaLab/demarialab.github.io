biography: "I am from Spain and obtained my BSc in Nursing in 2017 from the University of Santiago de Compostela. Before that, I obtained a Higher Technician degree in Clinical and Biomedical Laboratory in 2013. In 2018, I completed an MSc in Biomedical Research studying cellular reprogramming in the context of aging at the Cellular Senescence, Cancer, and Aging Laboratory, continuing my academic career as a PhD candidate. I obtained my PhD in Molecular Medicine in 2023, focusing on the discovery of new senolytic drugs for cancer therapy. That same year, I received a postdoctoral fellowship from Xunta de Galicia, allowing me to join the Demaria Lab for two years. My research now explores the impact of dietary fatty acids on aging and cancer. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, and spending time with my friends and cat."
