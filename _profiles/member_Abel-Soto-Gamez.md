biography: "I have B.Sc. in Biotechnology Engineering ITESM Monterrey Mexico / INSA Lyon France, and M.Sc. in Medical and Pharmaceutical Drug innovation, RUG, the Netherlands. In 2016 I started my PhD in the department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Biology at the University of Groningen in collaboration with the European Research Institute for the Biology of Aging (ERIBA). In my project I specialized in protein-based senotherapeutics. I am currently working as a Post Doctoral researcher in Radiotherapy and Molecular Cell Biology in the Department of Biomedical Science of Cells & Systems at the UMCG, under the supervision of Profs. Drs. Rob Coppes, Sarah Pringe, and Marco Demaria. I am especially interested in the identification of exploitable pathways for the selective elimination of senescent cancer cells in the salivary gland and the use of novel approaches to modulate pro-inflammatory aspects of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype."
