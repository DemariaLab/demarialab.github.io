biography: "I was born in Turin, Italy, where I completed both my BSc in biotechnology and MSc in molecular biotechnology. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I focused on cancer research, specifically investigating the tumor suppressive mechanisms in breast cancer. Since December 2023, I have been pursuing a Ph.D. at ERIBA (European Research Center for the Biology of Aging), working in Dr. Marco Demaria's lab. My research aims to explore potential connections between senescence and fibrosis-related events, with a particular emphasis on identifying senescence phenotypes in the autoimmune disorder known as systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. Besides my scientific pursuits, I have a strong passion for traveling, food, and cooking."
