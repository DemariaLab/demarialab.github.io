biography: "My name is Martijn Rutten and I come from the Netherlands. I did my BSc (University College Maastricht, a Liberal Arts and Sciences programme) and my MSc (Biomedical Sciences) at Maastricht University. During my MSc, I pursued internships in the laboratories of prof. dr. Cor Calkhoven (European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing (ERIBA)) and prof. dr. Marianne Rots (Department of Pathology and Medical Biology) at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). In September 2017, I started my PhD in the Department of Pediatrics in the UMCG under the supervision of dr. Maaike Oosterveer and prof. dr. Bart van de Sluis. In my PhD, I focused on metabolic imbalance-driven tumorigenesis in the inborn error of metabolism Glycogen Storage Disease type Ia (GSD Ia), especially focussing on understanding the role of phenotypic heterogeneity and nutrient sensors (specifically ChREBP and SIRT1). In September 2022, I started as a postdoctoral researcher in Marco Demariaâ€™s lab, where I will mainly focus on characterizing the effects of (intermittent) hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetic compounds in relation to senescence."
