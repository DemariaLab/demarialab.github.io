biography: "I was born in Padua, Italy, where I obtained both my BSc in Applied Pharmaceutical Science and MSc in Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Techniques. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I focused on developing a new natural senolytic agent, specifically investigating its mechanism of action and evaluating its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In October 2024 I started with my PhD under the supervision of Marco Demaria at ERIBA. My research will explore the links between aging and sex dimorphism, with a particular focus on understanding sex-specific responses to different anti-aging interventions. In my free time I like running, cooking cake and hanging out with friends."
