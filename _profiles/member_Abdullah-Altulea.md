biography: "I obtained a BSc in biomedical sciences (honors) from the University of Malaya, Malaysia; and a MSc in biomedical sciences (research) from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. During my Master's internships, I focused on molecular biology and the diseases of old age. I did one of my Masterâ€™s internships in Marcoâ€™s lab, where we studied the association between dietary macronutrients and cellular senescence in mice. I started my PhD in January 2022. I am currently interested in the differences between beneficial and detrimental senescence, and identifying transcriptomic profiles for each type. I mainly deal with single cell RNA-seq datasets and bioinformatics using R language. I also work at the lab to generate my own data."
