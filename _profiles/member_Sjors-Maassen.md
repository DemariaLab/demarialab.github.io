biography: "I come from Duiven (Gelderland) where I was born and raised. In Nijmegen I did a BSc in applied science from the Hogeschool Arnhem Nijmegen and a MSc in Clinical Biology at the Radboud University. During this time, I did four internships. Which ranged from sortase-reactions to construct nano-reactors from virus-like particles, mRNA-lipid nanoparticle synthesis, click-chemistry on peptides, to developing a transmembrane antigen model for T cell activation by cross-presentation in dendritic cells. After my MSc I moved to Groningen for my PhD at the group of Geert van den Bogaart. Here I specialized in inflammation biology driven by the immunometabolism of human blood-derived macrophages using various techniques. During my time at the Demaria lab I will work on detecting senescence in patient tissue with snRNA-seq."
