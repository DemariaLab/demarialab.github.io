biography: "I was born in the â€˜kop van Overijsselâ€™ but moved to Groningen to obtain both my BSc and MSc in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Groningen. During my bachelor's I got captivated by cellular senescence, which brought me to Marcoâ€™s group for my first master internship. Here I examined the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the induction of senescence. After graduating, I worked at the Radiotherapy and Molecular Cell Biology department of the UMCG for a year. As of July 2022, Iâ€™m happy to join Marcoâ€™s lab once again for a PhD project. This time I will work on a project that focuses on liver senescence."
