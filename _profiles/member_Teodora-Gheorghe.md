biography: "I grew up in Romania, where I also obtained my first degreeâ€“ a BSc in Biology. I decided to move to Groningen to learn more about the biology of aging at ERIBA. I enthusiastically participated in two research projects here, while completing a MSc in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Groningen. I was captivated by the work done in Marco Demaria's lab, which convinced me to remain here for a while longer. In partnership with the lab of Lene Rasmussen at the University of Copenhagen, we developed a project to study the intriguing link between mitochondrial dysfunction, oxygen-dependent metabolic control and the regulation of the senescent phenotype."
