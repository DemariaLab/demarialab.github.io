biography: "Marco is Full Professor in Cellular Ageing and Senescence at the Medical Faculty of the University of Groningen. He earned his PhD in Molecular Medicine from the University of Torino, Italy, where he studied the process of cellular transformation and mechanisms favoring senescence by-pass. Marco joined Prof. Judith Campisi's lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, California, for his postdoctoral work. In Campisi lab, he developed models for studying senescent cells and their roles in tissue repair, cancer, and aging. Returning to Europe in 2015, he joined the University of Groningen with a tenure-track position and started his research group at the European Institute for the Biology of Ageing (ERIBA). He became the founding director of the Mechanism of Health, Ageing and Disease (MoHAD) Institute at UMCG in 2023, and was promoted to full professor in 2024.
