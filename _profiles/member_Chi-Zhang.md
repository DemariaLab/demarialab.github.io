biography: "I was born in Hebei, China, and completed my BSc in clinical medicine at Fujian Medical University. Following that, I pursued an MSc in Nephrology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I conducted research at the Translational Medicine Center of Shanghai General Hospital. My master's research involved extensive work with transgenic mice, focusing on the role of the Hippo pathway in cell apoptosis during renal maladaptive repair following acute kidney injury. In November 2024, I joined Marcoâ€™s group with funding from the CSC. My primary research now focuses on how cellular senescence influences renal pathology after ischemic injury. Outside of academia, I enjoy learning new languages, traveling, and spending time with friends."
