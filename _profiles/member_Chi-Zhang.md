biography: "I am from China and completed my BSc in Clinical Medicine. Following that, I pursued an MSc in Nephrology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I conducted research at the Translational Medicine Center of Shanghai General Hospital. My master's research involved extensive work with transgenic mice, focusing on the role of the Hippo pathway in cell apoptosis during renal maladaptive repair following acute kidney injury. In November 2024, I joined Marco Demaria’s group at ERIBA to pursue a Ph.D. My primary research now focuses on the spatial, temporal and fuctional profiling of senescence after renal ischemia."
