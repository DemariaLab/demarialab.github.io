biography: "I was born in Sichuan, China, and completed my BSc in Clinical Medicine at Nanjing Medical University. After that, I pursued an MSc in Pulmonology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where my master’s research focused on the mechanisms of COPD and strategies to slow its progression. In November 2025, I began my PhD study under the supervision of Prof. Marco Demaria at ERIBA, supported by CSC funding. My PhD research explores the effects of liver senescence and aims to validate the efficacy of novel senolytic compounds. In my free time, I love taking photos and making videos to record my daily life, hiking, and spending time with my friends and family."
