biography: "I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Molecular Biology from the Lebanese University. During my masterâ€™s project, I focused on developing and characterizing a primate model for the Hepatitis B virus in CRCL (Cancer Research Centre of Lyon), Lyon, France. Because of my fascination with the biology of senescence, I received a scholarship and started my Ph.D. in Marco Demariaâ€™s lab in the spring of 2018 to study the complex phenotypes of senescent cells. My research is focused on understanding how a cell can decide between death and senescence in response to stressors, in addition to the implication of this decision in health and disease. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, reading, exercising and spending time with my friends."
