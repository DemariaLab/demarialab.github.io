biography: "â€‹I was born in Shanghai and my hometown is in Anhui Province, both of them are in the east of China. I obtained my BSc at Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2018 and my MSc at Beijing University of Technology in 2021. During my master's study, I mainly studied the role of specific genes in tumor development and the interaction between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. In November 2021, I arrived in the lab of Marco Demaria as a CSC-scholarship PhD student for further study. My current research interests mainly focus on mechanisms and functions of senescent cell accumulation in cancers."
