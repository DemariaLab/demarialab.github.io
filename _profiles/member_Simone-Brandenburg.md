biography: "Originally Iâ€™m from the province of Friesland but now I live with my family in Assen, the capital of the beautiful province of Drenthe. Drenthe with all its nature is ideal for trail running. Besides trail running I like to play water polo. I have been working as a research technician in the first 10 years of my career, at the Medical Biology department in the UMCG. At the laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, the main focus of research concerned COPD and Asthma using the following techniquesâ€“ (primary) cell cultures, ELISA, Western Blotting and ECIS. In September 2015 I became the lab manager of the Demaria lab, where my main task is to keep the lab running, and besides that Iâ€™m trying to implement new techniques to take our research to a higher level."
