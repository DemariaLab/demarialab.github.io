biography: "I am a biomedical specialist from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil, my country of origin. During graduation, I conducted research in two major areasâ€“ Neuroendocrine Physiology and Population Genetics. In Physiology, I developed in vivo experiments with the objective of understanding the response of the HMGB1 protein in the Hypothalamus-Neurohypophyseal Axis in the face of sepsis situations. In the area of Genetics, I worked with the development and updating of the Database of Genetic Profiles of a State in Brazil. I am now a PhD student, in the double-degree modality at the University of Groningen and at PUCRS in Brazil, and my main topic of interest includes microglia and their relationship with aging brain. In my free time I enjoy writing, exercising, and discovering new places."
