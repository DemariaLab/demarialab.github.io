biography: "I was born and raised in a small agricultural town on the prairies of western Canada. I picked up a BSc and MSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and spent a few years as a research associate studying KRAS-driven cancers of colorectal origin at the University of Northern British Columbia. Later, notwithstanding a couple great years in Vancouver at one of Canadaâ€™s largest biotechnology companies, I decided to pursue my PhD at ERIBA to help further our understanding of cellular senescence in age-associated degenerative disease. In partnership with the Dutch Society for Research on Ageing, and the Vitality Oriented Innovations for the Life course of Aging Society (DuSRA-VOILA), my work focuses on cellular senescence in tissues that make up our musculoskeletal system."
