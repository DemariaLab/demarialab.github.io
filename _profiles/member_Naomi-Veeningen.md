biography: "I completed my Master's in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Groningen, where I had the opportunity to intern in the labs of prof. dr. Inge S. Zuhorn at the UMCG (NL) and prof. dr. Lisbeth S. Laursen at the University of Aarhus (DK). In December 2020, I began my PhD at the University of Hasselt (BE) in the Department of Immunology, under the supervision of prof. dr. Niels Hellings and prof. dr. Helena Slaets. My research during this time focused on two key areas: 1) examining the effects of spinal cord injury in young and aged subjects (both mice and humans), and 2) investigating whether spinal cord injury can induce premature immune aging. In both projects, I specifically explored the role of senescent cells around the lesion site and its effects on the immune system of mice and humans. In January 2025, I joined the lab of prof. dr. Marco Demaria as a postdoctoral researcher. My current work explores the sex-specific differences in senescent cells and their interactions with the aging immune system."
