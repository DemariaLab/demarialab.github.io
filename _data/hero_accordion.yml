    and aging mechanisms in physiology and pathology. Our laboratory uses different
    mouse models to study the function of senescent cells in health and disease, including
    natural aging and various age-related diseases. Our state-of-the-art facilities
    ensure precise control over experimental conditions, and our phenotypic unit allows
    for longitudinal monitoring of various physical and behavioral parameters.

- description: Our research investigates the intricate role of senescent cells in
    injury and tissue regeneration under various conditions, such as skin wounds,
    exposure to environmental pollutants and ischemic events. We examine how these
    cells impact regeneration by both facilitating and impeding the repair process.
    By understanding the dual effects of senescence in regenerative contexts, we aim
    to develop targeted strategies to optimize healing and enhance tissue repair,
    paving the way for advanced therapeutic approaches.
